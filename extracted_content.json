  "page_5": "Introduction\nWelcome to Edexcel GCSE (9\u20131) Psychology\nExploring human behaviour\nThe new Edexcel GCSE course will help you to develop your knowledge and\nunderstanding of a wide range of topics in psychology. Using a \u2018key question\u2019\napproach, such as \u2018How does your memory work?\u2019 and \u2018How do others affect\nyou?\u2019, it investigates areas of human behaviour and allows you to relate them to\nyour own experiences.\nThere are many benefits to taking the Edexcel GCSE Psychology course.\n\u2022 It encourages you to carry out practical experiments and investigations where\npossible \u2013 helping to bring the subject to life.\n\u2022 It includes contemporary studies that are relevant to today\u2019s generation\nof students.\n\u2022 If you do well in this course you will be in a good position to progress to further\nstudy of psychology at AS or A level. The content of this GCSE is ideal grounding\nfor these qualifications, and it has been designed using a similar approach in\norder to make the experience of moving on as smooth as possible.\nHow you will be assessed\nThe GCSE course consists of compulsory and optional topics. You will study six\ncompulsory topics and two optional topics (which your teacher will choose).\nYour assessment will consist of two separate written exams. Paper 1 covers\ncompulsory topics 1 to 5 and accounts for 55 per cent of the total mark. Paper 2\ncovers the optional topics. It is worth 45 per cent of the final mark. Both papers\ninclude questions covering the content of Topic 11 Research methods.\nHow to use this book\nThis book contains all the information you need for the topics, theories and studies\nyou will be learning about. It also covers the key issues and debates relating to\neach of the compulsory topics. Each section guides you through the content of\nthe course in a practical and engaging way, making it clear what you will cover\nand providing useful activities and questions to help you practise what you have\nlearned. There are two dedicated sections to help you prepare for the exams.\nThe book is organised as follows:\n\u2022 compulsory topics 1 to 5\n\u2022 Preparing for your exam (Paper 1)\n\u2022 compulsory Topic 11 Research methods\n\u2022 optional topics 6 to 10\n\u2022 Preparing for your exam (Paper 2).\nTopic 11 Research methods has been positioned between the compulsory and\noptional topics, since you will need to draw on the research methodologies\ndescribed in both of your exam papers.\niv\nA01_PSYC_SB_GCSE_2773_PRE.indd 4 11/04/2017 12:15",

He said that\ndecentration, which means being able to separate self from the world and\nso \u2018see\u2019 other viewpoints, occurs as early as the first 18 months (Kesselring\nand M\u00fcller, 2011). A young child, by gathering information and changing\ntheir ideas to suit what they experience, comes to see themselves as\nseparate from the world. In the 1950s, Piaget suggested that decentration\noccurs in each of the stages, and that egocentrism, which means not\nbeing able to separate one\u2019s own perspective from that of others, features\nin different ways in all of the stages.\nThere are other studies that support Willingham\u2019s work and his arguments\nagainst Piaget\u2019s view that development is in stages.

Therefore, children in the pre-\noperational stage did not have the understanding of \u2018viewpoint\u2019 yet.\nOlder children were non-egocentric. They were able to look at the\nmountains as objects relating to one another, such as the larger one\nsometimes blocking the view of the smaller one. Older children were able to\nposition their own viewpoint among views of others and construct mental\nrepresentations of what others can see.
