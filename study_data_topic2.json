      "summary": "## 🧠 How Memory Works\n\n**Think of memory like a computer system:**\n• **Encoding:** Getting information IN (like typing data) 💾\n• **Storage:** Keeping information SAFE (like saving files) 🗄️\n• **Retrieval:** Getting information OUT (like opening files) 📂\n\n## 📥 Encoding Process\n\n**Three ways to encode information:**\n• **Visual:** What things LOOK like (pictures, colors) 👁️\n• **Acoustic:** What things SOUND like (words, music) 👂\n• **Semantic:** What things MEAN (understanding, concepts) 🧠\n\n*Example:* Remembering 'DOG' - you might see a fluffy image, hear 'woof', or think 'loyal pet'\n\n## 🏪 Storage Systems\n\n**Like different storage rooms:**\n• **Sensory Memory:** Brief snapshot (1-2 seconds) 📸\n• **Short-term Memory:** Temporary holding (15-30 seconds) ⏰\n• **Long-term Memory:** Permanent storage (lifetime) ♾️\n\n*Analogy:* Sensory = looking through window, STM = notepad, LTM = filing cabinet\n\n## 🔍 Retrieval Methods\n\n**Getting memories back:**\n• **Recognition:** 'I've seen this before!' (multiple choice test) ✅\n• **Recall:** 'I remember this!' (essay question) 💭\n• **Cued Recall:** 'This reminds me of...' (hints help) 💡\n\n*Example:* Seeing friend's face (recognition) vs remembering their name (recall)"
