Do results apply to other groups?\n‚Ä¢ **Situational generalisability** - Do results apply in other settings?\n‚Ä¢ *Example:* Study of London teenagers - can we generalize to all teenagers worldwide?\n\n### Factors Affecting Generalisability\n‚Ä¢ **Sample size** - Larger samples usually more generalizable\n‚Ä¢ **Sample characteristics** - Age, gender, culture, background\n‚Ä¢ **Setting** - Laboratory vs real-world environments\n‚Ä¢ **Time period** - Do findings apply across different eras?\n\n## üîÑ Reliability\n\n**Consistency of results when study is repeated**\n\n‚Ä¢ **Test-retest reliability** - Same results when repeated over time\n‚Ä¢ **Inter-observer reliability** - Different researchers get same results\n‚Ä¢ **Internal consistency** - All parts of test measure same thing\n‚Ä¢ **Split-half reliability** - Two halves of test give similar results\n\n### How to Improve Reliability\n‚Ä¢ **Standardized procedures** - Same method every time\n‚Ä¢ **Clear instructions** - Reduce confusion and variation\n‚Ä¢ **Training observers** - Consistent recording methods\n‚Ä¢ **Pilot studies** - Test procedures before main study\n‚Ä¢ **Multiple measurements** - Average out random errors\n\n## üìä Validity\n\n**Does the study measure what it claims to measure?**\n\n### Internal Validity\n‚Ä¢ **Cause and effect** - Does IV really cause DV changes?\n‚Ä¢ **Confounding variables** - Other factors affecting results\n‚Ä¢ **Participant variables** - Individual differences between groups\n‚Ä¢ **Situational variables** - Environmental factors\n‚Ä¢ **Researcher bias** - Experimenter expectations affecting results\n\n### External Validity\n‚Ä¢ **Ecological validity** - Applies to real-world settings\n‚Ä¢ **Population validity** - Applies to other groups of people\n‚Ä¢ **Temporal validity** - Applies across different time periods\n‚Ä¢ **Cultural validity** - Applies across different cultures\n\n### Threats to Validity\n‚Ä¢ **Demand characteristics** - Participants guessing aims\n‚Ä¢ **Social desirability** - Giving 'good' answers\n‚Ä¢ **Order effects** - Practice, fatigue, boredom\n‚Ä¢ **Hawthorne effect** - Behavior changes when observed\n\n## üåç Applicability\n\n**How useful are findings in real-world contexts?**\n\n‚Ä¢ **Practical applications** - Can findings solve real problems?\n‚Ä¢ **Educational implications** - How can schools use findings?\n‚Ä¢ **Therapeutic applications** - Can findings help treat disorders?\n‚Ä¢ **Policy implications** -

Excellent control over variables\n‚Ä¢ ‚ùå **Low ecological validity** - Artificial laboratory setting\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **High reliability** - Standardized procedures\n‚Ä¢ ‚ùå **Limited generalisability** - Often narrow, unrepresentative samples\n‚Ä¢ ‚öñÔ∏è **Ethics** - Generally good control, but may use deception\n\n### Field Experiments\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Higher ecological validity** - Real-world settings\n‚Ä¢ ‚ùå **Lower internal validity** - Less control over variables\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Good applicability** - Directly relevant to real life\n‚Ä¢ ‚ùå **Ethical concerns** - Participants may not know they're in study\n\n### Case Studies\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Rich, detailed data** - High applicability for understanding individuals\n‚Ä¢ ‚ùå **Very poor generalisability** - Single cases, cannot generalize\n‚Ä¢ ‚ùå **Low reliability** - Cannot replicate exactly\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **High ecological validity** - Real-life situations and contexts\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Generally ethical** - Usually involves informed consent\n\n### Naturalistic Observations\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Excellent ecological validity** - Natural behavior in natural settings\n‚Ä¢ ‚ùå **Very low internal validity** - No control over variables\n‚Ä¢ ‚ùå **Observer bias** significantly affects reliability\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Good applicability** - Directly relevant to real-world behavior\n‚Ä¢ ‚öñÔ∏è **Ethical issues** - Consent problems, especially in covert observation\n\n### Questionnaires/Surveys\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Good generalisability** - Can use large, representative samples\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **High reliability** - Standardized questions and procedures\n‚Ä¢ ‚ùå **Validity concerns** - Social desirability bias, self-report limitations\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Good applicability** - Easy to apply findings to populations\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Generally ethical** - Easy to obtain informed consent\n\n## üìù Writing Evaluations\n\n### Structure for Evaluation\n1. **Identify the method** used in the study\n2. **Assess reliability** - Can it be replicated consistently?\n3. **Evaluate validity** - Does it measure what it claims?\n4. **Consider generalisability** - Who do findings apply to?\n5. **Examine applicability** - How useful are findings?\n6. **Review ethics** - Was it conducted ethically?\n7. **Overall judgment** - Weigh strengths against weaknesses"
